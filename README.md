# DrumGen
An AI model project on generating drum sounds

The project is aimed at getting a guitar sound of 30s as input and generating a drum sound that would musically fit it.

For now the model is a flop, I will try my best to get it working.(hopefully)

A VAE with LSTM's and CNN's in the encoder is used. The data are turned into melspectograms to be put in the model.
