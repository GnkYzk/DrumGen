# DrumGen
An AI model project on generating drum sounds

The project is aimed at getting a guitar sound of 30s as input and generating a drum sound that would musically fit it.

For now the model has issues and only outputs beats without any flavor (like snare,cymbal etc.), I aim to fix it.I believe the major problem is in the data process section.

A VAE with LSTM's and CNN's in the encoder is used.
